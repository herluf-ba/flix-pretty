# flix-pprint

A pretty print library for Flix.

## Acknowledgment

This is an implementation of Daan Leijen's PPrint.

The original Haskell library was strictified for Mercury by Ralph Becket
and subsequently ported to Racket by David Herman. This library derives 
from both the Haskell library and Racket one.
